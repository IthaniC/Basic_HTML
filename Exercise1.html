    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p> My name is Chuma Cesibe, I have recently been given an opportunity to learn the basics of programming. <br> Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. <br> Humans need to be able to control the interaction between
        people and machines. <br> Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, we use computer programming to harness that computing power.
